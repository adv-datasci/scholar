### Scholar App Information
The `Scholar` shiny app helps you obtain information about citations, NIH/NSF grants and the teaching classes of faculty members at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. You can first choose a department name and use slider bar to select the scholar you are interested in. After your selection, the information about the position of the scholar and the courses he or she has taught in 2017 would show up.
