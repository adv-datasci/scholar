The `Scholar` shiny app helps you obtain information about citations, NIH/NSF grants and the teaching classes of faculty members at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. You can first choose a department name and then select the scholar you are interested in. After your selection, the app will display information on the scholar's academic position, citations, publications grants, and the courses the scholar has taught in 2017.
