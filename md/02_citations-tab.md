If you want to explore the scholarâ€™s citations, you can select `Citations` in the sidebar. The `Citations` page provides two sets of line charts, one pie chart and one table. The line chart on the left can either display the trend of total citations over years or the trend of total publication over years if you click on `Citations` tab or `Publications` tab on the right corner of the line chart. The pie chart on the right displays the proportions of the top 10 most cited paper. If you want to know more details, you can move your mouse over a specific dot in the plot or over a specific section of the pie chart.  The citation table at the bottom of the page displays details including title, publisher, journal, date and total citations of all articles of the scholar.  You can change the number of entries shown in the table by scrolling down the slide bar. You could also search the article you want in the right corner of the table.
