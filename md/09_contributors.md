We would like to thank two amazing contributors to this project: [John Muschelli](https://github.com/muschellij2) and [Stephen Cristiano](https://github.com/scristia). Both provided code snippets and guidance.

We thank [Stephen Cristiano](https://github.com/scristia) for his assistance with scraping the [JHSPH faculty website](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/).

For data scraping in particular, we relied heavily on `fedreporter` and `gcite` packages created by [John Muschelli](https://github.com/muschellij2).

For more information, please take a look at a list of packages we used during the creation of the project in the `Packages` tab.
