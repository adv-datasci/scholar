The teaching information for the school year of 2017 - 2018 was obtained by scraping web data from the [JHSPH faculty website](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/).

Through the process of reading HTML source file, removing non-faculty staff, and extracting the HTML `href` attribute, we have accessed to the URL of each faculty memberâ€™s teaching information, and then scraped the course lists from these websites.

We thank Stephen Cristiano for his assistance with scraping the [JHSPH faculty website](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/).
