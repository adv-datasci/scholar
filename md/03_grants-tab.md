If you want to explore the scholarâ€™s grants, you can select `Grants` in the sidebar.
The `Grant` page provides two plots and one table. The line chart on the left displays grant funding in dollars over years and the pie chart on the right displays the grant funding proportion of each project. Different colors are used to differentiate the funding projects. Similarly, if you want to know more details, you can move your mouse over a specific dot in the plot or over a specific section of the pie chart. The funding table at the bottom of the page displays detailed information (project number, fiscal year, project title and total funding amount in dollars) about the project. You can change the number of entries shown in the table by scrolling down the slide bar.
