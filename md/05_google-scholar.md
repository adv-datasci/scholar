The data of citation were acquired from Google Scholar using [John Muschelli](https://github.com/muschellij2)â€™s `gcite` R package. Citation information for Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (JHSPH) faculty members who have Google Scholar profiles was collected.

Data are stored in the form of a list of data frames with the citation information of each faculty member stored in a data frame. The data include titles of published articles, authors, publication dates, publisher, journal, total number of citations for each article and citation numbers in each year.

The final list of dataframes, named `cite_df_list.rds` is available in the top level of our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/adv-datasci/scholar).
