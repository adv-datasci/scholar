Teaching Courses: The teaching information for the school year of 2017 - 2018 was obtained by scraping web data from the [JHSPH faculty website](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/). Through the process of reading HTML source file, removing non-faculty staff, and extracting the HTML “href” attribute, we have accessed to the URL of each faculty member’s teaching information, and then scraped the course lists from these websites.
