We would like to thank two amazing contributors to this project: John Muschelli and Stephen Cristiano. Both provided code snippets and guidance.

We thank Stephen Cristiano for his assistance with scraping the [JHSPH faculty website](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/).

For data scraping in particular, we relied heavily on `fedreporter` and `gcite` packages created by John Muschelli.

For more information, please take a look at a list of packages and code snippets we used during the creation of the project in the `Packages` tab.
